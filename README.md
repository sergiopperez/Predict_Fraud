# Predict instances of fraud in bank transactions


__Objective__: train several models and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of fraud using data based [on this dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

Each row in fraud_data.csv corresponds to a credit card transaction. Features include confidential variables V1 through V28 as well as Amount which is the amount of the transaction.

The target is stored in the class column, where a value of 1 (positive) corresponds to an instance of fraud and 0 (negative) corresponds to an instance of not fraud.
